## Preliminary Results Working Group

**Preliminary Results Working Group** (5%): During Week 7, our two class sessions will be dedicated to presenting preliminary results or draft project plans if no results are possible at this point. These will be in "working group" format, where a first-cut of your final project results or design will be submitted to the class GitHub organization _a week prior_ to the working group. The class (myself included) will then review these results at the respective repo and prepare comments, questions, and offer feedback to the project teams the following week in class. All of this feedback will be via filing issue tickets in GitHub (be sure to label your issues accordingly as a clear indication of the substance of your comment, e.g., "question", "suggestion", or even create your own label if needed; this is a key part of software collaboration in the real world).

While we will work through each team's project systematically, there will not be sufficient time to go into great depth in class. As such, class time will be reserved for high-level discussion of each project, and then each student's feedback will be submitted to me for grading, at which point I will then distribute the feedback to the teams for them to consider and update accordingly. This will be a time to workshop problems encountered during the project as well as an opportunity to receive valueable feedback from peers. Again, this emulates the real world of computational social science and applied research.
	
_To reiterate_: As this working group will be prior to learning several methods, the "preliminary results" presented by your group could be in the form of a pre-analysis plan or design, rather than actual results. The goal is to present anything you have that is ready. _Note_: if your group is interested in a method we haven't yet covered by this point in the Quarter, be sure to schedule an appointment with me to discuss the feasibility of such a project. I can provide more tailored, preemptive instruction if necessary to ensure successful completion of your project.

Your responsibilities include:

1. Submitting your group's preliminary results (with everyone's names on the first page)
2. **Responding to at least *three* other projects** with a couple questions, comments, feedback of any flavor prior to the deadline included in the syllabus
